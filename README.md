The task is to use Apache Flink in order to generate a live application that tracks the traffic trends within the New York F.Kennedy Airport terminals per hour so the airport can pre-order the appropriate amount of cabs to be ready to serve on each terminal at every single hour of the day. 

Note: the data came from the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission which provides a public data set about taxi rides in New York City from 2009 to 2015.
